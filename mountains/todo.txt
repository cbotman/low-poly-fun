
- seeding

	- on load, set a random seed
	
	- write url to initial seed so can be shared
	
	- on load, if seed set in url, restore

	
- paper texture using perlin noise. apply to all of the things.

	- probably easier to calculate each texture at time of creating polygon. can make the texture
		the size needed. just means need to go point in world space. alternatively, don't suppose 
		threejs takes a 3d texture?
	
	- add uvs/texture to sides, base and trees
	

- add skydome and create gradient background

- look into having scene cast a floor shadow. horizon light?

- dof and tiltshift

- keyboard steering/navigation


- land-layer: remove magic numbers, turn them into options, such as colours and size

- more varied trees (shapes and sizes) and low poly shapes

- rocks and tufts of grass
