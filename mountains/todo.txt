- before going much further, add 'use strict' to everything

- use spotlight rather than 360 point light as camera



- need to understand how the ambient light works i.e. what it's effect is, and configure correctly

- paper texture using perlin noise. apply to all of the things.

- land-layer: remove magic numbers, turn them into options, such as colours and size

- color variations at a given height, e.g. little bit of brown getting into the greens. i think this should be a lookup with random variance

- merging height maps where each is configured for particular features. E.g. Grass/hills vs mountains?

- rocks and tufts of grass

- dof and tiltshift

- keyboard steering/navigation
