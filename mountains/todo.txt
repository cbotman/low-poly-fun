- use spotlight rather than 360 point light as camera. need to check if it's more efficient
	actually probably want directional or shadow

- play with directional light

- shadows



- color variations at a given height, e.g. little bit of brown getting into the greens. i think this should be a lookup with random variance


- merging height maps where each is configured for particular features. E.g. Grass/hills vs mountains?

- paper texture using perlin noise. apply to all of the things.

- dof and tiltshift

- look into having scene cast a floor shadow 

- land-layer: remove magic numbers, turn them into options, such as colours and size

- more varied trees (shapes and sizes) and low poly shapes

- rocks and tufts of grass

- keyboard steering/navigation

- add skydome and create gradient background
